  <em><strong>Preparing the steak</strong><em>

  <p><em><strong>Heat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and preheat a roasting pan.
      Trim any fat or sinew from the fillet of beef and season all over with salt and pepper.
      Heat a non-stick frying pan with a little olive oil.
      When it is very hot, add the beef and sear for 1½-2 mins on each side until evenly browned all over.</strong></em></p>

  <p><em><strong>Lightly oil the hot roasting pan.
       Transfer the beef to the roasting pan and place it in the oven.
       Roast for 25 mins for medium rare beef – it should feel a little springy when lightly pressed.
       Transfer the fillet to a warm platter and leave to rest for 10 mins.</strong></em></p>

  <p><em><strong>Serve the beef warm or at room temperature.
       Slice it thickly and overlap the slices on a serving platter.</strong></em></p>

  <em></strong><h2>Ingredients</em></strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1.2kg prime beef fillet (in one piece, cut from the thick end).</li>
    <li>Sea salt and black pepper.</li>
    <li>2tbsp olive oil.</li>

  <center><em><strong><h3>Succulent steak</h3></strong></em></center>

  <center><em><strong><p>For a perfect steak of any kind, you really need to start with a good quality, high-grade cut of beef.
     For a perfect pan-seared steak, a good rib eye or sirloin are our recommended choices.
     Try to select a thick steak (at least 1½ inches thick).</p></strong></em></center>

  <em><strong><p>Rump of beef is a large cut and benefits from being cut into sections to make cooking easier and more precise.
     The sinew that runs through the rump is tough to eat and is best removed before cooking.</p></strong></em>
