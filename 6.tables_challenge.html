<h4>Publishing</h4>
   <img src="https://www.gandhfinancial.com/img/~www.gandhfinancial.com/printing%20and%20publishing.jpg" alt="Publishing" height="320" width="480">
<p>Publishing is the dissemination of literature, music, or informationâ€”the activity of making information available to the general public.
   In some cases, authors may be their own publishers, meaning originators and developers of content also provide media to deliver and display the content for the same.</p>

<hr>

   <h4>Mathematics</h4>
   <img src="http://www.math-aids.com/images/Times-Tables-Worksheets.png" alt="Mathematics" height="480" width="320">
   <p>Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof.
      When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Periodic Table</h4>
   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg/1205px-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg.png" alt="Periodic Table" height="320" width="480">
<p>The periodic table of elements, often shortened to just the periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties, whose structure shows periodic trends.
   Generally, within one row (period) the elements are metals to the left, and non-metals to the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours placed in the same column.
   Table rows are commonly called periods and columns are   called groups.
   Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18 are the noble gases. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.</p>

<h4>Databases</h4>
   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Postgres_Query.jpg/1024px-Postgres_Query.jpg" alt="Databases" height="320" width="480">
<p>A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically.
   Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modeling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Software Applications</h4>
   <img src="https://media.buzzle.com/media/images-en/gallery/conceptual/technology/1200-application-software.jpg" alt="Software Applications" height="320" width="480">
   <p>An application software (app or application for short) is computer software designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user.
      Examples of an application include a word processor, a spreadsheet, an accounting application, a web browser, a media player, an aeronautical flight simulator, a console game or a photo editor.
      The collective noun application software refers to all applications collectively. This contrasts with system software, which is mainly involved with running the computer.</p>
