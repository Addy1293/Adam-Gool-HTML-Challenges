    <center><em><h1>My Journey To Become A Coder</h1></em></center>

    <center><p>This module has taught me how to create web pages and code it.<br>
       To go more into detail it shows one how to create validation forms that can be used for survey's.<br>
       Survey's can be sent out to people to be filled out.<br>
       We learnt how to use colours as back-grounds aswell as coloured texts.<br>
       The more difficult ones were the nested tables and Semantics.<br>
       This module has been very exciting for me.<br>
       I get excitement when something new is introduced.<br>
       Its hard at first but eases out the more I practice.<br></p></center>

<em><h3>Moving from Financial to Coding</h3></em>

<br>
       <p>I have found this article on a guy who studied to become a Chartered Financial Analyst.<br>
          He faced a difficult decision become a Chartered Financial Analyst or learn to code on a website called FreeCodeCamp.<br>
          He spent 4 years studying at a university and graduated with honors but why he gave it up?<br>
          He saw that software development was swollowing the world.<br>
          After reading about it he read that in a few years most businesses would want coders.<br>
          The net income for the tech industry was 3x more than banking.<br>
          He then made one of the toughest decisions of his life, to become a software developer and leave the finacial side.</p>
